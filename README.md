# About the program:
Women In Science and Engineering (W.I.S.E.) is a free annual symposium, founded by Poly Prep educators, Fleurette Turkenkopf and Jamie Nestor. Since it began in 2012, the one-day conference has inspired NYC middle and high school girls to pursue science and engineering and has introduced them to a wide range career options in STEM fields. Each year, girls from all over the tri-state area descend on the beautiful Poly campus in Brooklyn for a day of inspiration and creativity. They meet accomplished women who work in STEM fields and enjoy a day of hands-on experiences in a variety of workshops specifically designed for grades 5-12. In the workshops, girls collaborate to solve problems using creative design processes. Run exclusively by women, the girls who participate in W.I.S.E. are able to see themselves in the programâ€™s leaders. They leave empowered with the confidence to pursue higher education in STEM and a better understanding of a wide range of career opportunities they may pursue.
